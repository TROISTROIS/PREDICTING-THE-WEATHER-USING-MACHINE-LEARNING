# PREDICTING-THE-WEATHER-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This is a machine learning project to predict the weather. We'll be working with weather data from a station at the Oakland International Airport. The data is from 1960 through 2021. Each row in the data represents one day, and the columns represent different weather measurements.
